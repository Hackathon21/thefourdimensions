Over the last few weeks, India has reported 0.3 to 0.4 million COVID cases and 4 thousand deaths every day. We’re all badly hit by this second wave, and it’s not just numbers we are keeping an eye on. Every statistic has names and faces attached to it - of our loved ones, of the ones they loved. Running around the city to arrange for resources in times of scarcity and distress is unimaginable. Build a real-time tracker for the availability of vaccines, oxygen concentrators or cylinders, ICU or non-ICU beds in hospitals, recovery drugs, plasma/blood donors, and the likes in your city with map integration.
